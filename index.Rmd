# Introduction

The environment is one of the most important component for mankind. Interactions between humans\
and environment that occur continuously, will affect human behavior on the environment. Human attitudes and behavior will determine the good condition of an environment. The way humans treat their environment will have an impact on the quality of human life itself. Lack of human behavior that cares about the environment, causing global environmental damage. It encourages people today to change their behavior in an effort to reduce the harmful effects of environmental damage. Environmental protection and recovery are the main challenges facing our society today, therefore it is important to know and understand pro-environmental behavior in society, and what factors influence it. In this case, the adolescent is part of the community, which has the potential for environmental protection. Attitudes, knowledge, behaviors, concerns that the adolescent have about the environment either directly or indirectly influence future decision-making about natural resources and how their use can be sustainable. Therefore, the adolescent need to be motivate, in order becomes a pioneer for pro-environmental behavior, hence in that aged the challenges and modification toward environment more easily achieved. Scholars have various terms to describe behaviors that protect environment, such as; environmentally\
responsible behavior, environmentally concerns behavior, eco-friendly behavior, and pro-environmental\
behavior. Pro-environmental behavior is a behavior that harms the environment as little as possible but provides enormous benefits to the environment. Environmental education is considered important to increase individual knowledge, positive attitude, and eco-friendly behavior. Based on this exposure, it becomes important to know the importance of pro-environmental behavior in adolescent.

In this Data Analysis Project, I have analyzed the **pro-environmental attitude among the college students of India**. I have used several Statistical and Psychometric Tools to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis, Inference and Modeling of the Survey Data to come to a valid conclusion.

## Motive

The motive of conducting this study is mentioned below-

-   Finding out the overall pro-environmental attitude and behavior among the college students of India and visualizing the results.

-   Understanding the underlying correlation between the items(or questions asked) by different domains or aspects of pro-environmental attitude(see next section).

-   Understanding the underlying correlation between the different domains of pro-environmental attitude.

-   Finding out the domains, we need to impart knowledge on to improve on the overall pro-environmental attitude among college students of India.
