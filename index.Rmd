# Abstract

Data collected from college students of India, composed mainly of students of Indian Statistical Institute and few other colleges like Indian Institute of Technology, National Institute of Technology and few other colleges spreading mostly around West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, was analyzed for their inclination towards pro-environmental attitude based on their response in a Pro-Environmental Attitude Questionnaire Survey. Several interesting relation between the environmental variables and domains were found out. Suggestions for improvement of the environmental awareness and current areas of poor pro-environmental score among the students were identified.

# Acknowledgement

This study is a project as a part of Pro-Environmental Attitude Study, using statistical techniques, in my psychology course. It wouldn't have been possible without the constant support of my friends and resources to turn the idea I had in mind into a finished detailed report. I would also like to thank my psychology Prof. Debdulal Dutta Roy, for choosing such an important topic for this project which has great essence in today's world, where climate change and environmental pollution is at it's peak.

Finally, I would also say that it was the outcome of constant efforts and dedication of proper time from my side that played the pivotal and most important role in completing this thorough detailed study.

# Introduction

The environment is one of the most important component for mankind. Interactions between humans\
and environment that occur continuously, will affect human behavior on the environment. Human attitudes and behavior will determine the good condition of an environment. The way humans treat their environment will have an impact on the quality of human life itself. Lack of human attitude that cares about the environment, causing global environmental damage. It encourages people today to change their attitude in an effort to reduce the harmful effects of environmental damage. Environmental protection and recovery are the main challenges facing our society today, therefore it is important to know and understand pro-environmental behavior in society, and what factors influence it. In this case, the adolescent is part of the community, which has the potential for environmental protection. Attitudes, knowledge, behaviors, concerns that the adolescent have about the environment either directly or indirectly influence future decision-making about natural resources and how their use can be sustainable. Therefore, the adolescent need to be motivate, in order becomes a pioneer for pro-environmental attitude, hence in that aged the challenges and modification toward environment more easily achieved. Scholars have various terms to describe attitude that protect environment, such as: Social Support, Recycling, Reusing, Conservation, Reducing, Perceived Control and Sensitivity towards Environment. Pro-environmental attitude is a attitude that considers harming the environment as little as possible but provides enormous benefits to the environment. Environmental education is considered important to increase individual knowledge, positive attitude, and eco-friendly behavior. Based on this exposure, it becomes important to know the importance of pro-environmental attitude in adolescent.

In this Data Analysis Project, I have analyzed the **pro-environmental attitude among the college students of India**. I have used several Statistical and Psychometric Tools to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis, Inference and Modeling of the Survey Data to come to a valid conclusion.

## Objective

The motive of conducting this study is mentioned below-

-   Finding out the **overall pro-environmental attitude and behavior among the college students of India** and visualizing the results.

-   Understanding the underlying **correlation between the items(or questions asked) by different domains or aspects of pro-environmental attitude**(see next section).

-   Understanding the underlying **correlation between the different domains of pro-environmental attitude**.

-   Finding out the domains, we **need to impart knowledge on to improve on the overall pro-environmental attitude** among college students of India.

-   Observing the trend in the response like the **composition of the overall pro-environmental score**.

## Importance

Studies like this is very important in understanding the pro-environmental attitude in psychology. Some reasons of why such studies are of great importance are as follows-

-   **Environmental Education** is effective to it's fullest extent and constitutes an important part of a **child's development into a responsible human being**.

-   Understanding the **domains where the college students lack good perception or idea** on would **help us frame better study plans, coursework and activities for school students** to nurture better environmental attitude.

-   Helps in understanding **human-nature interaction**.

-   Measuring a country's **overall education index** as an important part of a student's education is environmental education.

-   Better **understand the variables involved in study** which can be as complex as social support, perceived control, etc.

# Literature Review

Since attitudes are generally more easily acquired in childhood, the study of environmental education should begin at an early age. Dewey (1996) states that education at a young age is very important in raising awareness, creating desirable behaviors and encouraging positive attitudes towards the environment. G ̈uven(2013) emphasizes that individuals with a positive environmental attitude show positive behaviors towards the environment and that determining the level of attitudes of individuals towards the environment and environmental issues and taking necessary actions in accordance with the results in terms of elimination is of great importance and avoidance of environmental problems. People with a negative attitude towards the environment do not react to environmental problems and can even become part of the problems (Ulu ̧cınar Sa ̆gır et al., 2008). Therefore, having a positive attitude towards the environment is very valuable for people of all ages, gender, professional and socio-economic background.

The future of the planet is in the hands of the youth: they are the decision makers of the future. It is therefore necessary to understand what drives children and young people to behave in a pro-environmental manner. Policy makers, curriculum developers and designers of environmental education programs have expressed a keen interest in knowing how environmental attitudes develop among young people and what causes the differences in these attitudes. Young people's environmental attitudes have also become a growing topic for social scientists. Most research aimed at explaining differences in (adolescent) environmental attitudes focuses on the individual as a measurement level. However, individuals operate within a social structure; they are part of a context. People are born into and grow up in a cultural environment that influences and shapes their attitudes and behaviors (Giddens 1997). Therefore, rather than viewing the individual as just themselves, a better level of measurement would be the individual in their context. Attitudes are expressed in actions and in the interaction between people. The context and the social groups we belong to limit what we do, feel or think. Kellert (1983, 1986, 1991, 1993) therefore focused on examining the willingness of people of different nationalities and social groups to make personal sacrifices in favor of the environment and wildlife. It seems obvious that the most important factor influencing nature is not official environmental policy, but the public's willingness to care for the environment and bear the costs of minimizing the negative impacts of their activities (Ramsey Rickson, 1976).
