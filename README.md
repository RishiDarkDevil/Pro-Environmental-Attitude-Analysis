# Pro-Environmental Attitude Analysis
This is a study to measure the pro-environmental attitude among the college students of India.\
In this study, I have done extensive research, data analysis and have applied several statistical and ML tools to draw necessary inference about the pro-environmental attitude inclination among the students in my sample. I used these results to provide important suggestion for improvement of environmental education among school students.\
I have learnt several techniques and better approaches to data analysis, while doing this project-
- Revisited and understood better the unsupervised learning techniques of PCA and hierarchial clustering.
- Several similarity based distance metric that can be used for hierarchial clustering(for example- Jaccard Distance, Cosine Similarity, Lp-Norm Distance)
- Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.
- Reliability Analysis of Survey Data.
- Item Response Theory Analysis.
- `forcats` for efficient handling of categorical data.
- Advanced functional programming skills with `purrr`.
- I have developed several wrapper functions for beautiful visualization of functions like `lm`, `prcomp`, `alpha`.
- `factoMineR` for factor and principal component analysis.
- `psych` for psychological data analysis.

All the `.R` files contain the codes that I wrote while exploring the data on my own, the names of these files are pretty self-explanatory. The final code that made it to the study are written in the `.Rmd` files. The study is available [here](https://rishidarkdevil.github.io/Pro-Environmental-Attitude-Analysis/). The `docs` repo contains the rendered book files and the `_bookdown_files` repo contains the figures and plots used throughout the study. The data collected is available in the `PEAData.csv` file.
